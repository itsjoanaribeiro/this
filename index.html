        <font color= "#ffffff">“Does your desire for Dior shoes, Comme des Garçons clothes, an Apple iPod, and a Nespresso machine come from need? Is design necessary? (...) We no longer have any desire for design that is driven by need.”</font> 
        <font color= "#0000ff">“(...) design is in fact the aesthetic refinement of an invention (...)”</font>
        <font color= "#ffffff">“ En masse, designers throw themselves into desires instead of needs.”</font> 
        <font color= "#0000ff">“ The real designer then becomes his own client.”</font>
        <font color= "#ffffff">“If designers are labourers, then their labour can be purchased at the lowest possible price.”</font> 
        <font color= "#0000ff">“ The title of designer exists by way of what it excludes.”</font>
        <font color= "#ffffff">“Is a designer someone who thinks up ideas, designs, produces, and sells, or someone who holds a mouse and drags objects across a computer screen?”</font> 
        <font color= "#0000ff"> “Let the designer take on the debate with the institutions, the brand names or the political parties, without it all being about getting the job or having the job fail. Let designers do some serious reading and writing of their own. Let designers offer the surplus value, the uselessness and the authorship of their profession to the world, to politics, to society.”</font>
        <font color= "#ffffff">“The title is not even regulated: anyone can call himself a designer.”</font> 
        <font color= "#0000ff">“ (....) design should instead begin asking interesting questions.”</font>
        <font color= "#ffffff">“Instead of giving the wrong answers (...)”</font>
